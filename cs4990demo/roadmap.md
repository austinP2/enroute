# AI-Powered Travel Planner - Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Initial Planning & Setup (Weeks 1-2)
- **Define User Flow**: 
  - User inputs destination, budget, interests, and trip duration.
  - AI generates a personalized itinerary with suggested activities, accommodations, and restaurants.
- **Tech Stack Selection**: 
  - Choose frontend (React.js or Vue.js), backend (Node.js or Python), and AI integration tools.
- **Set up Development Environment**:
  - Version control with Git/GitHub.
  - Initialize frontend and backend projects.

## Phase 2: Frontend & User Interface Development (Weeks 2-4)
- **Design User Interface**:
  - Simple input forms for destination, budget, duration, and interests.
  - Display area for suggested itinerary.
  - Plan for a responsive, mobile-friendly design.
- **Develop Frontend Components**:
  - Create components for user input (destination, budget, interests).
  - Design a results page to display the generated itinerary.
- **Basic Navigation & User Flow**:
  - Implement routes (e.g., homepage, itinerary view).
  - Design and implement basic navigation.

## Phase 3: AI Integration & Backend Development (Weeks 4-6)
- **Set up Backend**:
  - Set up API endpoints to receive user input (destination, budget, etc.) from the frontend.
  - Create a database schema (e.g., MongoDB) to store user preferences, itineraries, etc.
- **Integrate AI Model**:
  - Use gemini API for generating personalized itineraries.
  - Fine-tune the prompt to produce relevant suggestions based on user input (e.g., "Generate a 5-day itinerary for a budget traveler visiting Paris who enjoys history and art").
  - Optional: Use OpenWeather API for weather forecasts during the trip.
- **Generate Itinerary Logic**:
  - AI generates the list of activities, lodging options, and restaurants based on input.
  - Incorporate a system for budgeting recommendations and cost estimation.

## Phase 4: User Interaction & Itinerary Customization (Weeks 6-8)
- **Allow Itinerary Customization**:
  - Users can edit the suggested itinerary (e.g., add/remove activities, change dates).
  - Option for users to save itineraries to their profiles or export them as PDFs.
- **Optimize Budgeting**:
  - Add a feature that calculates total trip costs based on the itinerary.
  - Suggest budget-friendly alternatives if the user exceeds their budget.

## Phase 5: Testing & Quality Assurance (Weeks 8-10)
- **Test AI Model**:
  - Ensure the AI generates realistic and relevant itineraries based on different input combinations.
  - Check for any potential issues in handling diverse locations, user preferences, and budget constraints.
- **Frontend Testing**:
  - Conduct user interface tests to ensure responsiveness and usability.
  - Test form inputs and data display (e.g., activity list, budget suggestions).
- **Backend Testing**:
  - Test API calls for correct data retrieval and AI response generation.
  - Ensure database connectivity and correct data handling.

## Phase 7: Post-Launch & Maintenance (Ongoing)
- **User Feedback**:
  - Collect feedback from users and improve the app based on suggestions (e.g., better recommendations, more destinations).
- **Add More Features**:
  - Support for multiple languages and currencies for global travelers.
  - User accounts for saving itineraries, preferences, and past trips.
  - Integrate with flight booking services (e.g., Skyscanner, Kayak) for complete travel planning.
- **Ongoing Maintenance**:
  - Ensure AI models stay up-to-date.
  - Handle any bugs or technical issues post-launch.

## Milestones:
- **MVP Completed**: End of Week 8.
- **Official Launch**: End of Week 12.
